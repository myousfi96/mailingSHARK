Subject: [k3b] k3b hal backend not finding devices
Message-ID: <4BBB2382.8040005@gmail.com>

Hello,

on a machine with debian squeeze and k3b 1.90.0~rc1 i have hal running, 
but is not finding devices (parallel ata dvd burner). It was upgraded 
from k3b 1.x which was working beautifully. I've found the same issue in 
the gentoo bug here:

http://bugs.gentoo.org/292281

In the bug it is suggested to use policykit instead of hal as backend. 
Would you reccomend that too as safer choice for a distribution?

thanks,
riccardo

I've read roughly through the bug report and frankly I don't get it.
HAL is an abstraction layer for hardware (hence its name) and PolicyKit is 
used for user authentication which K3b already uses through KAuth

Ok i don't argue with that, so i've digged the issue a bit more:
- solid does not see the device
- hal does not see the device
- kernel sees the device (tried both 2.6.30 and 2.6.32)

So it looks it's not a k3b issue, sorry for the noise :)

thanks,
riccardo

Hi all,

My name is Chris Smart and I am (among many other things) a masters
student at the Australian National University. I'm currently taking an
intensive course on FOSS development and part of the assessment of
this course is to work with a FOSS project. I'd like to work with K3b
(cause it's awesome).

I am required to write a report on the project, including history,
governance and all that sort of thing, but I also need to contribute
something :-)

I believe that the current documentation for upcoming 2.0 release has
not yet been updated, so I'm offering to have a crack at that. I have
already discussed this with Sebastian and Micha?, but if anyone has
some suggestions, I'm all ears!

Thanks for your time.

Cheers,
Chris

Hi.

My personal opinion is that built-in Doxygen-based documentation is read my no 
one. I'd rather see updated documentation on KDE's UserBase wiki.
Once the updated k3b.org is launched, the UserBase article will be linked to 
it anyway.

I also like UserBase more. UserBase article
(http://userbase.kde.org/K3b) has better chance being updated in the
future than regular handbook. On the other hand it will be
inconsistent with other KDE apps.

Sorry I replied to Markus off-list accidentally saying that's a good idea.
OK, I'll look into that. At some point it could probably go to back
into the Docbook.

You could try to make it a KDE standard by creating a dedicated
formatting that can be used by the KDE help system in some way or at
least be linked from the help menu in KDE apps.

Cheers,
Sebastian

Hi Sebastian,

That's an interesting suggestion. Perhaps the UserBase Wiki could be
linked in K3b's Handbook, rather than having old doco there? Or
perhaps a change could allow the Handbook to pull the HTML down
directly from the Wiki and render it in Handbook. Either way, I do
think that having a manual in the application is useful (what if
people have no Internet connection?), and at least better than out
dated information :-)

Anyway, if people are more interested in the UserBase Wiki for now,
then I could concentrate on that and see if I can improve it. We could
deal with DocBook (or some other method) down the track. Free time is
scarce for me in-between full time work, part time study and
freelancing, but I'll do my best!

Cheers,
-c

No need. In Kdenlive we simply have the line
X-DocPath=http://kdenlive.org/user-manual
in the .desktop file. Works just fine.

One alternative to just link to the wiki could be to create a snapshot of the 
wiki pages before release and then converting them to KDE's help system.
I have to add though that I have no idea how easy or hard that would be.

In any case: Existing documentation for all languages has to be imported into 
UserBase first.

Interesting, thanks for that tip. I might have a play with this myself
at some point.

I suspect that it will be easier to go from DocBook -> HTML -> Wiki
markup, but that's just an initial though.

Understood, thanks.

A quick question about the UserBase documentation - should I update
this in preparation for the 2.0 release, or wait until 2.0 is out
before updating it, so that the documentation is correct as of current
stable version?

Thanks,
Chris

The docs there already cover a Platform 4-based prerelease of 2.0. So go ahead 
and update it. :)
